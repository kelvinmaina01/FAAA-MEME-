## Auditory Feedback for Diagnostic Chaos

**Faaaaaahhh** is a Visual Studio Code extension designed to turn developer suffering into high-fidelity entertainment. Every time a new error hits your editor, it plays the iconic **FAAAH** meme sound. Warnings get a softer, slightly less judgmental **AA**.

Whether it's a red squiggle, a failed build task, a crashed debug session, or a mistyped terminal command — if your code is broken, everyone in the room will know.

### Key Features

- **Severity Tiers** — Minor syntax typos are chill. Dropping 10 errors at once triggers high-frequency chaos.
- **Smart Audio Engine** — Works natively on Windows, macOS, and Linux with independent process spawning for realistic overlapping.
- **Settings Panel** — A graphical UI to tune volume, cooldowns, and quiet hours without touching JSON.
- **Sound Packs** — Switch between `Meme`, `Rage`, and `Chill` modes instantly.
- **Terminal Watcher** — Caught slipping in the terminal? Non-zero exit codes trigger the sound too.
- **Victory Mode** — (Opt-in) A satisfying sound for when you finally clear all errors in a file.

---

## How it Works

The extension monitors four distinct VS Code event channels:

| Channel | Triggering Event | Sound |
|---|---|---|
| **Diagnostics** | `onDidChangeDiagnostics` | New red/yellow squiggles appear |
| **Tasks** | `onDidEndTaskProcess` | Build task fails with non-zero exit |
| **Terminal** | `onDidEndTerminalShellExecution` | Command not found or script failure |
| **Debug** | `onDidTerminateDebugSession` | Session crashes or exits with error |

**The Diff Engine:** The extension only triggers sounds when the error count for a specific file **increases**.

---

## Usage & Commands

Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) to access these tools:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `Faaaaaahhh: Toggle Sound` | Quickly mute/unmute the extension |
| `Faaaaaahhh: Settings Panel` | Open the graphical configuration dashboard |
| `Faaaaaahhh: Test Sound` | Preview your current error sound pack |
| `Faaaaaahhh: Switch Pack` | Cycle between bundled sound profiles |

### Quiet Hours
Set **Quiet Hours** in the Settings Panel to automatically silence all sounds during specific windows (e.g., `09:00` to `17:00`).

---

## Configuration

While the Settings Panel is recommended, you can also configure everything in `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "faaaaaahhh.enabled": true,
  "faaaaaahhh.volume": 80,
  "faaaaaahhh.soundPack": "meme",
  "faaaaaahhh.quietHoursStart": "22:00",
  "faaaaaahhh.quietHoursEnd": "08:00",
  "faaaaaahhh.victoryEnabled": false
}
```

---

## Installation

**Marketplace:** Search for `Faaaaaahhh` in the VS Code extensions view.

**Manual:**
```bash
code --install-extension faaaaaahhh-0.3.7.vsix
```
